## Windows

Opening Star Rod from VSCode may not work on Windows. Instead:

- [Download the latest version of Star Rod](https://github.com/z64a/star-rod/releases/latest)
- Extract the ZIP file
- Run the `bat` file
- Select the papermario-dx folder as your project directory
    - You will need to [access the WSL filesystem](https://www.howtogeek.com/426749/how-to-access-your-linux-wsl-files-in-windows-10/) to find the folder
    - The path will be something like `\\wsl$\Ubuntu\home\yourusername\papermario-dx`
